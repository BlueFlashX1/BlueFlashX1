## Aspiring Data Analyst | Biology Background

**Graduate Student** pursuing a Master's in Data Science at the University of Arizona (Expected: May 2026). I have a B.S. in Biology with a Data Science minor, and I'm drawn to roles where I can combine analytical thinking with my interest in healthcare, biology, and AI-driven applications.

I enjoy building automations to solve repetitive problems and writing scripts that make workflows more efficient — whether that's data pipelines or personal productivity tools.

## Beyond Coursework

I enjoy scripting and automation outside of class:

- **Forked & fixed** a broken multi-account manager tool, adding new features with AI assistance
- **Built personal scripts** for PC performance optimization and scheduled task automation
- Drawn to programming because it lets me solve problems efficiently and work independently

---

## What I'm Looking For

**Target**: Entry-level **Data Analyst** roles (open to Junior Data Scientist opportunities)

**What I bring**:

- Analytical skills in Python, SQL, and R that transfer across industries
- Biology background as domain expertise for healthcare and life sciences
- Genuine interest in AI-driven applications and automation

I'm early in my career and focused on finding a role where I can learn and grow. While I'm drawn to healthcare and biology, I'm open to opportunities in other industries where I can contribute and develop as a data professional.

**Work style**: I prefer working independently and value efficiency, but I collaborate well when needed.

## Let's Connect

I'm actively seeking opportunities where I can grow as a data professional while contributing to meaningful work.
